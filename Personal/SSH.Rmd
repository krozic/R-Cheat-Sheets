Make your ssh key in git-bash:

```{bash, eval = F}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your.email@email.com"
#tell it where to save the file
```

Add the ssh with `ssh-add`. This makes it so you don't have to type in credentials everytime you push.

```{bash, eval = F}
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Add the .pub file to RStudio git/SVN.

Add the contents of ~/.ssh/id.rsa.pub to github settings.

Check that ssh-authentication worked:

```{bash, eval = F}
ssh -T git@github.com
```
